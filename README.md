GamerEngine is a free and open source 3D game engine!


#### Installation
Just run the program or download the latest release on the side.
If you wanna use the source code it will compile the code and run the engine directly if there are no issues with the current build.
If you wanna use the development build that can include bug and compile errors. 
use the <a href="https://github.com/Maikatura/GamerEngine/tree/Development">development</a> build.
I will try to not have compile errors on the main branch. 
I also will make every class that will be used like vectors and other types that is needed on my own to handcraft what I need.
Feel free to use or modify anything on this project!


#### Info
This engine uses DirectX 11 to run and I will try to support at least Windows and Linux. 
But I will focus on Windows first since windows has the most market share on computers.
I won't support macOS sorry :D But not really sorry.

#### LICENSE! <br>
I will change this once I have a license I wanna use for this project.<br>
But it would be one that you need to give attribute to me in the source files.
