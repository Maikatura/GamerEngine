GamerEngine is a free and open source 3D game engine!


#### Installation
Just run the program or download the latest release on the side.
If you wanna use the source code it will compile the code and run the engine directly if there are no issues with the current build.
If you wanna use the development build that can include bug and compile errors. 
use the <a href="https://github.com/Maikatura/GamerEngine/tree/Development">development</a> build.
I will try to not have compile errors on the main branch.

#### LICENSE! <br>
I will change this once I have a license I wanna use for this project.<br>
But it would be one that you need to give attribute to me in the source files.
