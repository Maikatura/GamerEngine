# GamerEngine
#### This Game Engine is built from another game engine called [BirchEngine](https://github.com/carlbirch/BirchEngine)

### Questions you might have.
**Can you add [Insert Thing] to the engine?**
Short answer: No.
Really this game engine will not be what people want me to add to the game engine. This game engine will be released with a game im working on that I am making my own engine for. Therefore most features will be releated to what I need to my game project.

**Can I use this Game Engine?**
Short answer: Yes and No.
Some part of the code is not what I have made and therefore you need to look up the license for librarys and other stuff in that category. But when it comes to the parts I have done yes go ahead. Use as long giving credit.
