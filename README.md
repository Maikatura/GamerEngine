### Questions you might have.
**Can you add [Insert Thing] to the engine?**

Short answer: No.

Really this game engine will not be what people want me to add to the game engine. This game engine will be released with a game im working on that I am making my own engine for. Therefore most features will be releated to what I need to my game project.

**Can I use this Game Engine?**

Short answer: Yes and No.

Some part of the code is not what I have made and therefore you need to look up the license for librarys and other stuff in that category. But when it comes to the parts I have done yes go ahead. Use as long giving credit.

**Why is there so much Networking in the Todo list?**

Short answer: I'm making a Multiplayer game.

**Can I use the assets in the Assets folder?**

Short answer: No.

I commission people or made all the assets in that folder. If you use them you're using copyrighted material. Personal use is okay. If you plan to use them in other projects that is not for personal use contact me! If you contact about using the assets (pictures) for FREE don't bother to contact me because you will get a NO.

**What type of game engine is this, topdown, 3d...?**

Short answer: 2D Multiplayer Side scroller

The game engine like I said is for my game that will be a 2D Sidescroller that is multiplayer. So its a 2D Sidescroller MMORPG. If you wanna use the game engine for the exact same reason and start your own game with it sure go ahead as long you credit me and [carlbirch](https://github.com/carlbirch) in the credits of the game. Where will the credits be? Button on login screen.
